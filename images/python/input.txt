Ralph Waldo Emerson the Transcendentalist famous for writing the essay Self Reliance was also widely known for his poetry A common theme across nearly all of Emerson’s poetry is the presence of nature and the power it possesses The concept of the natural world appears in poems such as Ode to Beauty Each and All Good-Bye and various others In the poem Ode to Beauty Emerson demonstrates the powers of beauty and spends a majority of the time describing just how bitter-sweet beauty can be however a key point in this poem is the idea of the ever-presence of beauty in nature and just how synonymous these two things can be Emerson speaks of beauty as being a Sweet tyrant of all He calls beauty an intimate stranger and says that it is latest and first This implies that beauty is capable of unifying dichotomies such as these and that it is present in everything In the first stanza the speaker says Thy dangerous glances Make women of men New-born we are melting Into nature again Emerson claims that men are often helpless before beauty To him beauty is divine and is worthy of its own category His stating that beauty makes us new-born again and melts us back into nature establishes the idea that all things in life lead back to nature and the immediate world we live in In the second stanza he calls beauty a lavish promiser and calls it Guest of million painted forms focusing on its appearance in all things and all art In this stanza he writes The frailest leaf the mossy bark The acorn’s cup the raindrop’s arc The swinging spider’s silver line The ruby of the drop of wine The shining pebble of the pond He lists off various things in nature emphasizing the importance in realizing the beauty in the natural world that surrounds us The speaker continues in the third stanza by giving into the mighty beauty of the world around him Emerson if he would like to live freely must acknowledge the power in the beauty of nature Emerson goes from one extreme to the other describing the sun and the sea valleys and skies and the young and the old in an effort to demonstrate just how ubiquitous beauty is in the natural world In the fourth stanza he again describes beauty Thee gliding through the sea of form Like the lightning through the storm Somewhat not to be possessed Somewhat not to be caressed No feet so fleet could ever find No perfect form could ever bind He makes sure to use natural phenomena such as the movement of the sea and lightning to prove to the reader just how powerful and incredible both nature and beauty are Toward the end of the stanza beauty and nature become synonymous He calls it an eternal fugitive never being able to be caught says that it hovers over all that live again implying that beauty is in everything around us and says that beauty is quick and skillful to inspire sharing with us just how powerful nature and beauty are spiritually In stanza 5 Emerson insists that All that’s good and great with thee Works in close conspiracy Here he tells the reader that all that is good and great in beauty works together This is yet another way Emerson details the beauty of the blending of all things natural Finishing the poem he states Queen of things I dare not die In Being’s deeps past ear and eye Lest there I find the same deceiver And be the sport of Fate forever Dread Power but dear If God thou be Unmake me quite or give thyself to me Emerson calls to beauty saying he wishes never to leave the natural world he lives in he would only be willing to go if he could find the same beauty after death In his poem Each and All Emerson focuses more directly on the beauty of things in nature He emphasizes the beauty that is found in the conjunction of all things natural Starting the poem he describes a scene of many parts Little thinks in the field yon red-cloaked clown Of thee from the hill-top looking down The heifer that lows in the upland farm Far-heard lows not thine ear to charm The sexton tolling his bell at noon Deems not that great Napoleon Stops his horse and lists with delight All are needed by each one Nothing is fair or good alone The final sentence of this quote is exactly what he aims to show in this work nothing is fair or good alone and beauty relies on the collaboration of many parts He makes a point in this excerpt to show the reader the beauty of nature and the perspective of an observer The man in the field does not consider that one might watch him the cow aims only to go on with its life as usual and the sexton is in no way aware that Napoleon might stop to listen to the tolling of his bells On their own these things are unassuming every day happenings but together they epitomize the concept of nature and the idea that life goes on for all no matter the situation He says later I thought the sparrow’s note from heaven Singing at dawn on the alder bough I brought him home in his nest at even He sings the song but it pleases not now For I did not bring home the river and sky He sang to my ear– they sang to my eye Here Emerson recounts a time where he learned the concept he is demonstrating He thought the bird was beautiful but the sparrow’s songs meant nothing alone The bird was pleasing to his ears but without the rest it just wasn’t the same This further supports the idea that one thing on its own is not as powerful or as meaningful as it is in its respective natural environment Completing this poem Emerson writes As I spoke beneath my feet The ground-pine curled its pretty wreath Running over the club-moss burrs I inhaled the violet’s breath Beauty through my senses stole I yielded myself to the perfect whole Emerson finishes the poem describing just how beautiful the environment around him is He engrosses himself in the pine needles beneath his feet the moss and burrs below him and the floral aroma of violets He allows himself to fall into the natural beauty of his scenery and takes in every bit of it through each of his senses In the poem Good-Bye the speaker starts saying Good-bye proud world I’m going home Thou art not my friend and I’m not thine He starts the poem off with a farewell to the world he lives in claiming no fondness to it He says Long through thy weary crows I roam A river-ark on the ocean brine Long I’ve been tossed like the driven foam But now proud world I’m going home Here he compares himself to an ark meant for a river but placed in the sea His whole life Emerson writes that he has been tossed back and forth and has not found his place in the world he lives in He wishes to go home meaning he wishes to remove himself from the society he is in He bids farewell to a whole list of things from society and civilization he doesn’t expect to miss I am going to my own hearth-stone Bosomed in yon green hills alone– A secret nook in a pleasant land Whose groves the frolic fairies planned Where arches green the livelong day Echo the blackbird’s roundelay And vulgar feet have never trod A spot that is sacred to thought and God In this stanza Emerson informs the reader that he would like to retreat to a place of solitude and nature To him nature is as important as his spirituality and mind He values the natural world far more than he does society and culture and makes a point to say that he is most confident and most secure when he is surrounded by the natural world he knows best When he is safe in his sylvan home he treads on the pride of Greece and Rome Emerson makes it very apparent that he does not value the same things as society being those things are pride confidence and dominance He completes the poem reinforcing this idea into the overall purpose of the poem He says And when I am stretched beneath the pines I laugh at the lore and the pride of man At the sophist schools and the learned clan For what are they all in their high conceit When man in the bush with God may meet Emerson again finds the lore and the pride of man to be ridiculous and unimportant Societal constructs and learned selfishness hold no merit to him He would much rather surround himself with the natural world Nature brings Emerson closer to the world around him brings sense to his reality and unites him and the world spiritually Ralph Waldo Emerson widely known as the leader of the Transcendentalist Movement spent a lot of time stressing the importance of nature in his works In a variety of his works the reader is shown these ideas through a multitude of rhetorical devices Thematically nearly all of his poems relate on the basis that they focus on the power strength and beauty of nature and the natural world
